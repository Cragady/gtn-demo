# Guidelines

* white and blue color theme
* Easily updatable front-page, latest article first
* Under headers, lead article should appear like a banner of a banner
* Rest should be news papery with layout
* Important pages: Home, about, contact
* Search tags implementation

# Right Now

Just work on styling to show

So white and blue are the main color themes here, cuz they promote happiness haha
On the front page, if possible, it should be easily updated to whatever the latest article is, if not make it automatic if possible.
Under the headers, lead article should be like banner a banner, and the rest kind of like a newspaper layout ya know?

Important pages are obviously the front page (home) and then other headers should be about and contact. 
Eventually there will be more but for now basics haha
Also! Search tags if possible xD like being able to hashtag things for easy finding
It's a big idea >.> So I don't blame you if you can't make it all work. But that's my 
(current) vision for how I hope the site looks eventually. Work with it how you will xD
