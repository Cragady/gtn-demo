# Right Now

Just work on styling to show

# Guidelines

* Split the array/object being parsed. eg pictured store 1-3 then text-link only stories 3-8; pictured > textlink > pictured > text-link etc. . .
* white and blue color theme
* Easily updatable front-page, latest article first
* Under headers, lead article should appear like a banner of a banner
* Rest should be news papery with layout
* Important pages: Home, about, contact
* Search tags implementation
